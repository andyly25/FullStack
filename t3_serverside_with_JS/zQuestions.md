# Questions:
- Was told to clone a repository, and so I forked the repository
  - after I tried `git clone git@github.com:birisora/node-intro-to-unit-testing-1.git`
    - it failed giving *Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository*
    - the https version worked instead
  - now I am to use `git remote set-url`, but messages appeared and nothing happened
    - after googling was supposed to do
      - `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/birisora/node-intro-to-unit-testing-1`

- encountered problems with `git push`
  - git push
  - fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/birisora/Challenge-Blog-API.git/': The requested URL returned error: 504
    - worked after coming back to it later
