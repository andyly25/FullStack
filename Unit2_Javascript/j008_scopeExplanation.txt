What is scope?

Scope is like a boundary that is set for variables. When variables are outside of said boundary, they are up for grabs by anyone and everything to be used, thus they become global variables. Local variables is similar to the term "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas," those variables are created within the boundary and when the  function ends, it disappears and no one outside would know what happened. Global is like the Black Plague which introduces side effects into the code, where values can change without your knowledge and cause a lot of bugs. Side effects can cause functions to be indeterminate, where if given a function, will not spit out the same results given the same values fed into it. To avoid this problem, you impose a sanction disallowing global variables through `use strict`. If nothing harmful is introduced by mistake, then our functions will remain 'pure' as long as function is determinate with no side effects.
