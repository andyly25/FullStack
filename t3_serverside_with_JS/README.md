# Server-side with JS
- Architecting modern server-side web applications using Node and Express
- Automated software testing
- Mongo
- Basic DevOps (Heroku, TravisCI, database-aas platforms)

## Overview: 
- Unit 1 covers server-side JavaScript fundamentals. 
  - The goal of this unit is to get you comfortable designing, implementing, testing, and deploying simple Express apps.
- Unit 2 is dedicated to the topic of persistence layers and data modeling. 
  - You'll learn how to provision and work with Mongo and Mongoose ORM, which allow us to manage persistence through the JavaScript layer of the application.
- In unit 3, you'll gain experience architecting complex server-side applications.
  - You'll also learn the basics of handling user authentication, account management, and access control. At the end of unit 3, you'll complete a capstone project.

### Lesson 1: Welcome to Server-side
- discuss what server-side programming is all about, irrespective of JavaScript, the particular language we'll be focusing on in this course.
- get an overview of Node.js and the Express application stack, and tour some simple web apps that demonstrate basic web app functionality.
- learn how to serve static assets (i.e., HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files).
- discuss URL request and response objects

#### Notes/Wrap-up questions:
- Explaining in your own words what server-side programming is about.
- Explaining what Node and Express are.
