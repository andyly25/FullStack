# User Flow

**Home Screen**
________________
- User clicks logo -> returns to *Home Screen*
- User types in search bar -> *Search Results*
- User clicks among list of popular books -> *Book info page*
- User clicks on return to top button -> goes back to top

---

**Search Results**
________________
- if search could not find search item -> error message and option to return
- if search was found -> list clickable books with information -> book info if clicked
- Button to return to home Screen -> return to Home Screen
- Side button to return to top of page -> back to top of page

---

**Book Info Page**
________________

- Store links clicked -> user redirected to store
- Book image clicked -> enlarges the book's image
- User clicks on button to return home -> return home page













## Future implementation if time permits:
- add a cart feature to add books -> leads to *checkout page*
  - *checkout page* -> turns list into a pdf or txt file for the user
  - note this might deal with persistent data and will disappear if user refresh if not implemented correctly
