# Linked Lists:
- data struc meant to store ordered collections of data
- works by storing a series of nodes
    - *node* consists of a value, and pointer to next node
    - can be spread out in memory
- why are arrays used more often than linked lists? **Cache Locality**
    - Need to know how CPU works first
    - when CPU try to access data it loads directly from RAM
        - mem access is slow so introduces small memory caches into processor
        - when access data from mem, stores some into nearby caches
        - and CPU can pull data from caches more quickly than from RAM
    - works well for arrays since stored in contiguous memory
        - big chunk of array loaded into caches, so fast access
    - Nodes in LL are spread throughout memory so unlikely to be found in caches
        - loads far more data from the Ram, resulting in performance penalty
