# Learn React
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) is a frontend library used to build user interfaces
  - when data in app changes, user interface auto updates
  - built from series of reusable components for interface
  - uses virtual DOM to store copy of current DOM in memory
    - calculates which parts of DOM needs to change when updating and only update those elements
