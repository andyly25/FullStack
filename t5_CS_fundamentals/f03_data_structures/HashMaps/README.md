# Hash Maps
- unordered associations between keys and values
    - basically what an object is without additional protoype extras
- storage of hash map is an array
    - each key/value pair is stored in one of the array slots
    - how to store is by taking a value, and convert into a number
        - num then used as index into array
        - any input has almost equal chance of being hashed to any output index
- main difficulty is collisions
    - what happens when 2 keys hash to same slot in array?
        - *Separate chaining*: Each slots hold a linked list
            - when you want add a value, hash the key, find slot, then add pair to list
        - *Open addressing*: when there is collision, add pair to nearest empty slot where it should live
    - by having max load ratio, minimizes chance value ends up long way away from hash pos due to slots being full
